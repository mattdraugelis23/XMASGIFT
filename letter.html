        I am so excited to spend our first Christmas together, you mean the world to me and it is so amazing to be with you. I can't wait to grow old with you and spend more and more holidays together and create our own traditons. You are my perfect sweet angel and I love everything about you. I truly hope you know how important you are to me and how much you mean to me. You are everything I could ever ask for in life. I am so proud of you in so many regards everyday, and it is such a honor to be able to spend my days with you. I know life has been hard recently with a lot of things happening at once, but you have been handling things so well and I am so proud of you in that regard.

        Love, <br />
